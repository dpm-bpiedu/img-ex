    <p class="key-point">People, too, sometimes give the <strong>wrong answers</strong> on tests because they get <strong>nervous</strong> and <strong>scared</strong>. That&rsquo;s what often happened to Jacob.</p>
    <p>Tests scared the pants off him. When he sat down to take one, he would quickly forget every
      sensible thought and well-memorized fact he had stuffed into his brain.</p>
    <p>His test results were a disaster.</p>
    <p>They greatly chagrined his mother&mdash;especially when, following a series of countywide
      achievement tests, the principal called her in.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Jacob should probably stop dreaming about going to university and becoming a
      professor,&rdquo; said the principal. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s other stuff he can do.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>But Jacob didn&rsquo;t stop dreaming. He just kept trying to educate himself. &ldquo;They
      can&rsquo;t teach me more stuff just by giving me more tests,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s about as
      sensible as thinking you can make yourself thinner just by weighing yourself a lot.&rdquo;</p>

  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
    <p class="intro">Jacob was a bright young man (his uncle once described him as having a brain as big
      as a planet). But he was a victim of what psychologists label <strong>test anxiety</strong>.</p>
    <p class="intro">The thought of any sort of assessment, and the fear that he would not do well, invariably led to an
      emotional state that interfered with his performance. As Jacob explained it, school assessments made him feel
      like a cat that&rsquo;s falling with its back to the ground and it just can&rsquo;t seem to get its feet
      pointed the right way.</p>

    <div class="right-column">
      <p class="key-point">Assessment can be like that for some students: highly <strong>threatening</strong> and <strong>anxiety
        provoking.</strong></p>
      <p>This is especially the case when the student&rsquo;s performance has profound implications not only
        for the learner, but perhaps also for the teacher, the school, the parents, and others&mdash;a situation labeled <strong>high-stakes testing</strong>&nbsp;(discussed in Chapter 10).</p>
      <p>But assessment in many of today&rsquo;s schools is very different from what it was in Jacob&rsquo;s
        school.</p>
      <p>In fact, the best current approaches to classroom assessment are designed less to
        determine how well or how poorly students perform than to help them learn.</p>
      <p>Such approaches to testing might well have uncovered Jacob&rsquo;s problem and led to solutions for
        it before he abandoned all hope.</p>

      <div class="single-column">
        <p class="key-point">This chapter looks at current approaches to <strong>educational assessment</strong> and at its various <strong>purposes</strong> and <strong>forms</strong>.</p>
        <p>It explains how assessment is driven by the main, overriding goals of the educational enterprise, how
          curricula are designed around these goals and how assessments are used to gauge the extent to which goals are
          being met.</p>
        <p>It looks at the implications of the various pieces of legislation that direct and influence
          educational endeavors.</p>
        <p>It examines some of the rules and regulations designed to ensure that assessments are as fair,

    <h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Question</span> <span class="focus_q">What are the most important purposes of educational assessment? <br />
      How are summative, formative, and placement assessments different?</span></h2>
  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
    <p class="intro">Educational assessment has two broad purposes:</p>
    <p>{{infographic}}</p>
    <p class="intro">The first purpose is the most important, strongly reflected in today&rsquo;s assessment literature
      (e.g., Stiggins &amp; Chappuis, 2017). That purpose is emphasized throughout this text.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section-body">
    <h2 class="h2">Summative Assessment</h2>
    <div class="single-column">
      <p class="key-point">Assessment used mainly to provide a mid-term or year-end grade or to assess mastery at
        the end of a unit is called <strong>summative assessment</strong>.</p>
      <p>Summative assessment has traditionally been the main function of testing in schools, partly because
        the historical emphasis has been on sorting learners to select those with the highest probability of future
        success.</p>
      <p>Today, selecting students is no longer the principal mission of our schools, as
        Stiggins and Chappuis (2017) explain. Now schools also need to ensure that learners learn how to
        learn&mdash;that they become competent, self-directed learners, actively involved in their own learning. </p>
        
        
        <div class="text_container">
          <h4><button class="ec_expand" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="ecbox1-2">LEARN MORE</button></h4>
          <div id="ecbox1-2">
            <p class="tx">But yesterday&rsquo;s approaches to education do not work well for the school&rsquo;s new
              mission, or for today&rsquo;s students, argues Prensky (2011; 2012a; 2012b). Today&rsquo;s learners are very
              different learners: They are members of what is sometimes labeled the <strong>net generation</strong>;
              Oblinger &amp; Oblinger, 2005) (or the <em>Z generation</em>, the <em>iGen</em>, the <em>post-millennials</em>,
              or any of a variety of other competing labels). Basically, these are learners so profoundly influenced by
              digital technologies such as the Internet, video games, and computers that they think and learn differently
              from older generations of students. (We look at some characteristics of today&rsquo;s learners and at their
              impact on learning and assessment in Chapter 3).</p>
            
             
            <p class="tx">Because today&rsquo;s learner is different, and because what we expect of our schools is also
              different, contemporary emphases are changing. They reflect our beliefs and intentions regarding the main
              purpose of schools. Today&rsquo;s model is more egalitarian: It advocates success for all rather than success
              for the chosen few. Furthermore, educators such as Prensky (2016) argue strongly that education for the
              future should be less about improving individuals than about improving the world. In his words, &ldquo;Kids
              now need an education that is far more connected and real than in the past&mdash;an education that gives them
              not only knowledge, but also provides them with empowerment and agency&rdquo; (p. 1). Accordingly,
              today&rsquo;s teacher views assessment mainly as a tool to provide guidance and assistance&mdash;a tool
              designed to make today&rsquo;s student a highly competent, self-motivated, life-long learner. The hope is
              that this learner will also be imbued with the motivation and passion to make the world a better place.</p>

    <div class="inner-section">
      <h2 class="h2">Formative Assessment</h2>
      <div class="single-column">
        <p>Assessment designed to improve the teaching/learning process is <strong>formative
          assessment</strong>. It consists of the huge variety of methods teachers use to assess and assist learner
          progress and comprehension during a lesson, a course, or a unit.</p>
        <p>Put another way, formative assessment is assessment <em>for </em>learning; summative
          assessment is assessment <em>of </em>learning.</p>
        <h3 class="h3">Characteristics</h3>
        <p>Formative assessment is assessment that is embedded in the teaching&ndash;learning process. Much of
          it is informal rather than structured and formal:</p>
        <ul class="checklist">
          <li>consists of ongoing strategies such as questions, quizzes, and observation of student performances and
            products.</li>
          <li>involves providing frequent and timely feedback aimed directly at improving teaching and learning.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Instead of summarizing achievement with a number or a grade (summative assessment),
          formative assessment provides information upon which teacher and learner may act before formal grading occurs.</p>
        <h3 class="h3">Key to Assessment in Schools</h3>
        <p>As Hattie (2012) puts it, &ldquo;The primary function of assessment is to support learning by
          generating feedback that students can act upon in terms of where they are going, how they are going there, and
          where they might go next&rdquo; (p. 126). Hence, the primary purpose of assessment in schools is
          (or should be) formative.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2 class="h2">Placement Assessment</h2>
    <div class="single-column">
      <p>As the name implies, <strong>placement assessment</strong>&nbsp;is designed to provide
        information relating to the placement of a learner. It typically occurs prior to an instructional sequence,
        and looks at the learner&rsquo;s readiness for a lesson, a unit, a course, or an entire program.</p>
      <p>Placement assessment often includes <strong>diagnostic assessment</strong>, which&nbsp;is directed
        specifically at identifying learner strengths or learning problems and the reasons for them.</p>
      <p>For example, diagnostic assessment might be used to determine whether a learner would benefit from
        being placed in a group that receives remedial instruction in reading or mathematics.</p>
      <p>That learners and educational emphases are changing doesn&rsquo;t mean, of course, that all teachers
        stress the formative role of assessment more than its summative uses. Some critics point out that many of
        today&rsquo;s schools still reflect the approaches and emphases of past centuries.</p>
      <p>Groshell (2017), for example, notes that although there have been enormous advances in technology and
        in educational goals, relatively little has changed in how schools view learning and in how they design the
        learning environment. Still, there is little doubt that the uses and purposes of educational assessment are
        changing. And even less doubt that they should.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="inner-section">
      <h2 class="h2">Performance-Based Assessment</h2>
      <div class="single-column">
        <p>Another important category of educational assessments is <strong>performance-based assessment</strong>.
          Performance-based assessments ask learners to demonstrate their skills, knowledge, and
          understanding by actually performing a task or producing a product that directly illustrates what is being
          assessed. Thus, performance-based assessments can be used for both formative and summative purposes.</p>
      </div>
      <figure class="photo-left"> <img src="Images/f1.jpg" alt="sample figure" title="sample figure" />
        <figcaption class="large-caption">
          <h4 class="figure_name"><span class="figure_number">Figure 1.1</span><br />
            <span class="figure_title">Sample first-grade rubric for reading</span></h4>
          <p class="caption">This is a small part of a first-grade rubric for assessing early literacy skills. Other
            related objectives might have to do with writing skills, punctuation, captalization, word-attack skills,
            reading strategies, understanding of what is read, and so on. Each objective would be clearly explained, and
            the performance criteria associated with each of the numbered grading descriptors would be spelled out. Most
            school systems provide teachers with similar, detailed scoring and grading guides.</p>

            Temporibus, obcaecati. Iure, ipsum.</p>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <div class="right-column">
        <p  class="key-point">For example, asking first-grader William to read aloud from one of the worksheets that accompanies
          the <em>Beginning Reader</em> series is performance-based assessment.</p>
        <p>Judging William&rsquo;s performance according to the <strong>rubric</strong>, a type of scoring guide
          described in Chapter 7 and shown in Figure 1.1, provides a basis for using the descriptor <em>Meets Standard</em> on his electronic report card. This would be an example of the use of performance assessment for <em>summative</em> purposes.</p>
        <p>If, in the course of observing and assessing William&rsquo;s reading performance, the teacher
          notes that he consistently confuses the letters <em>b</em> and <em>d</em> as well as <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>&mdash;a
          common error&mdash;she can then use this information to adjust her instructional approach and provide William
          with additional help. This example illustrates how performance-based assessment can be used for <em>formative</em> purposes.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
    <p class="intro">To summarize: As Figure 1.2 illustrates, assessment might occur before instruction and might be the
      basis for decisions regarding placement of learners (placement assessment).</p>
    <p>Placement assessment might also involve <em>diagnostic assessment</em>, the main purpose of which is
      to identify learner strengths and weaknesses, to diagnose learning problems, and perhaps to uncover the reasons
      for them.</p>
    <p>Assessment that occurs during instruction is <em>formative</em> to the extent that it provides
      feedback to assist in the learning process. Formative assessment is an integral part of the
      teaching&ndash;learning process rather than something that occurs only before or after instruction.</p>
    <p>Assessment that occurs after instruction is usually <em>summative</em>: Its purpose is to summarize
      learner progress and achievement.</p>
    <p>Formative assessment is discussed in Chapter 5, summative assessment is detailed in Chapter 6, and
      performance-based assessment is the subject of Chapter 7.</p>

          assessment might be either structured and formal or highly informal. Although an assessment procedure might
          seem mainly summative, diagnostic, or intended for placement decisions, one of the overriding general
          purposes of most approaches to educational assessment is formative in the sense that it is meant to improve
          student learning.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
    <p class="key-point, intro">To make the best possible use of all forms of assessment in education, three fundamentally important
      points need to be kept in mind from the outset:</p>
    <ol class="nl">
      <li>Assessment is an integral part of the teaching&ndash;learning process.</li>
      <li>Assessment is not simply something that teachers do to students; it&rsquo;s something that is
        accomplished collaboratively by learners and teachers.</li>
      <li>The most important purpose of educational assessment is to provide information to enhance
        student motivation and learning, and to improve instructional approaches.</li>

        approaches to instruction and to learning&mdash;all of which rely on good assessment&mdash;are continuous,
        ongoing processes.</p>
      <p>The most useful assessments for instructional purposes are informal and frequent ungraded assessments

        <h3>Test</h3>
        <p>In education, the word <strong>test</strong> typically refers to specific instruments
          or procedures designed to measure student achievement or progress, or to identify various student
          characteristics.</p>
        <p>Tests typically consist of a sample of behaviors (responses) that serve as a basis for making
          inferences. For example, a ninth-grade algebra final test does not examine candidates&rsquo; complete body of
          algebraic knowledge or their ability to solve all algebraic problems related to the entire course. Instead, the
          test consists of a representative sample of problems. If a student responds correctly to 84 percent of the
          problems, the examiner infers that the student also would have responded correctly to 84 percent of the entire
          pool of relevant problems.</p>
        <p>Test results are often <em>quantitative</em> (they provide a numerical measure such as 90 percent, or
          a grade with clear meaning such as a B), but sometimes they are <em>qualitative</em> (they describe some
          particular quality such as <em>Meeting all standards</em>, or <em>Excellent descriptive paragraph</em>). Tests,
          whether they are teacher-made or professionally produced, are a relatively formal approach to assessment. They
          are common in placement and summative assessment, but less common in formative assessment, which tends to make
          greater use of more informal assessments.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="single-column">
        <h3 class="h3">Measurement</h3>
        <p>Measurements&nbsp;are usually quantitative: They are used to provide an indication of amount. Thus, I <em>measure</em> the length of my foot in inches or centimeters; but I can <em>test</em> its suitability for
          running by putting it through a series of movements.</p>
        <p><strong>Measurement</strong> in education is usually based on the results of tests.
          Strictly speaking, educational measurement is a set of procedures for manipulating and interpreting the results
          of tests.</p>
        <p>For example, educational measurement might involve decisions about specific, measurable levels of
          performance that indicate acceptable performance in a unit test, or that might be used for identifying learners
          in need of assistance.</p>
        <h3 class="h3">Assessment</h3>
        <p><em>Assessment</em>is a more general term. In an educational setting, <strong>assessment</strong> refers to all the activities&mdash;including testing and measuring&mdash;undertaken by a teacher to obtain
          information about students&rsquo; characteristics, their progress and achievement, and the effectiveness of
          instructional methods in relation to desired outcomes.</p>
        <p>There is a strong belief that in the 21st century, assessment should be a collaborative process,
          engaging both learner and teacher, and perhaps involving parents as well. In this sense, assessment reflects a
          commitment to achievement and progress, and the recognition that assessment-based feedback is an essential
          component of the teaching&ndash;learning cycle.</p>
        <p>Educational assessment is no longer viewed as a mysterious, secretive, teacher-controlled process.
          Today&rsquo;s learner should be able to access assessment-based, formative feedback in collaboration with the
          teacher&mdash;perhaps by means of face-to-face interactions or via online digital technology.</p>
        <h3 class="h3">Evaluation</h3>
        <p>Literally, <em>evaluation</em>&nbsp;refers to the process of making a value judgment. It may involve
          deciding that something is good or bad, moral or immoral, effective or ineffective.</p>
        <p>In education, however, evaluation is seldom as subjective as this definition might imply. <strong>Evaluation</strong> is usually based on the results of one or more assessments, and it often takes the form of an appraisal based
          on whether certain criteria have been met.</p>
        <p>For example, qualifying for special needs services in primary grades usually requires meeting
          specific evaluation criteria related to speech and language difficulties, social and emotional problems, or
          behavioral problems.</p>
        <h3>Grade</h3>
        <p><strong>Grades</strong>&nbsp;are generally numbers, letters, or verbal descriptors that
          describe a particular rank or quality. Thus there are different grades of beef, of lumber, of wheat, of
          paper&mdash;and yes, even of students.</p>
        <p>In education, grades are summative rather than formative. They are usually based on the results of
          tests or other forms of assessment. Occasionally, as we see in Chapter 11, they might also reflect other factors
          such as performance on assignments or class participation.</p>

    <h2 class="h2">What We Measure</h2>
    <div class="single-column">
      <p class="key-point">Assessments, measurements, and evaluations are a huge part of everyday life.</p>
      <p>You have been subjected to assessments of one kind or another all your life. In all likelihood,
        within a few minutes of being born, a nurse or attending physician gave you the well-known <strong>Apgar test</strong>&mdash;a
        test which assessed your general <strong>a</strong>ppearance (blue or pink), your <strong>p</strong>ulse (heart
        rate), your <strong>g</strong>rimace (reflexive reactions such as coughing, sneezing, crying, or, yes,
        grimacing), your <strong>a</strong>ctivity level (muscle tone described as limp, weak, or strong), and your <strong>r</strong>espiration.</p>

          7&ndash;8 is &ldquo;good,&rdquo; 4&ndash;6 is &ldquo;intermediate,&rdquo; and lower scores are
          &ldquo;poor.&rdquo; Incidentally, over 90 percent of U.S. infants score 9 or 10, and fewer than 0.5 percent

      <p>The Apgar test is just one of many assessments you might have had even before you started school.</p>
      <p>For example, perhaps your vision was tested, the condition of your teeth appraised, or your health
        evaluated. Your general developmental progression might have been formally assessed by one or more developmental
        experts. And it would most certainly have been informally evaluated by proud or concerned parents: <em>I wonder
        why Luca&rsquo;s not walking yet; Tansy&rsquo;s not even 8 months and she can walk!</em></p>
      <p>In many ways, life is a series of formal and informal assessments. Some show how
        well you are performing compared to your peers; others appraise your performance relative to some standard or
        norm that describes expected or average behavior or achievement.</p>
      <p>And, of course, the preschools and schools that follow bring with them a whole range of new
        assessments.</p>
      <p>At the very least, schools typically measure student achievement; most also assess various kinds of
        aptitude or ability. They might also examine personality, vocational and career interests, and performance in
        different subject areas.</p>
      <p>Some of the assessments used involve formal measuring instruments, often produced by professional
        test developers. Others are constructed by teachers.</p>
      <p>Often, too, assessment is based on more informal kinds of observations both in and out of the
        classroom. Some of the various types of school assessments are described in Table 1.3.</p>

    <h2 class="h2">How We Use Results</h2>
    <div class="single-column">
      <p class="key-point">It is important to keep in mind that the chief purpose of all the different approaches to educational
        assessment is to foster learning. However, each of the broad approaches to assessment described in Table 1.3
        might serve a variety of different purposes in the classroom, including:</p>
      <ul class="bl, checklist">
        <li>Determining whether learning goals are being met</li>
        <li>Assessing the effectiveness of instructional methods</li>
        <li>Gauging the extent to which learners are engaged in learning</li>
        <li>Monitoring student achievement</li>
        <li>Providing information for parents</li>
        <li>Satisfying administrative and judicial requirements</li>
        <li>Appraising learner satisfaction and happiness</li>
        <li>Determining student background information and readiness to learn</li>
        <li>Helping learners make wise decisions</li>
        <li>Developing self-assessment skills among learners</li>
        <li>Making decisions about student advancement and placement</li>
        <li>Advising students regarding career and vocational decisions</li>
        <li>Tailoring instructional methods to student aptitudes and interests</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h2 class="h2">What Information Learners Need</h2>
    <div class="single-column">
      <p class="key-point">Most of the purposes for which educational assessment might be used are not mutually exclusive. A
        single well-constructed, teacher-made, end-of-unit test might serve every one of the purposes just listed.</p>
      <p>However, the kind of assessment information the learner needs is quite different from
        the assessment information that might be given to parents. Interested parties such as parents, prospective
        employers, and university admissions officers are mainly interested in summative information that allows them to
        compare and evaluate. That is, they want to know what the learner has achieved relative to educational goals and
        relative to other learners. On that basis, they can predict what the learner is capable of, provide advice about
        educational and career options, and make decisions about placement.</p>
      <p>In contrast, what learners need in the day-to-day business of learning is immediate,
        personalized, confidential information about their learning. They need formative information that will
        enhance their ongoing learning.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
    <p class="intro">Educational assessment has an enormous influence on what students study and how they
      learn. In the final analysis, students try to learn what they expect teachers to test&mdash;which is,
      presumably, what teachers teach.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section-body">
    <h2 class="h2">When Tests Don&rsquo;t Measure Up</h2>
    <div class="single-column">
      <p>Unfortunately, what teachers test is not always what they claim is important.</p>
      <p>For example, Elena&rsquo;s high school English teachers, Mr. Teske, constantly emphasizes the
        importance of critical thinking and independent reflection. He spends hours of class time analyzing and
        critiquing various literary works, speculating on the moral virtues of the characters, and asking students to
        offer personal opinions on abstract literary matters.</p>
      <p>But during the last class of every Friday, Mr. Teske routinely presents his learners with a
        fill-in-the-blank quiz consisting of questions like these:</p>
      <ul class="l-none">
        <li>
          <p class="tx">The author of <em>Wuthering Heights</em> is _________.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="tx">The person who said, &ldquo;Beware the ides of March&rdquo; was ________.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="tx">Supply the missing line:</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="tx"><em>You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!</em></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="tx"><em>O you </em>______________________________________</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="tx"><em>Knew you not Pompey?</em></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Students quickly learn that if they are to do well, they should memorize as much as possible. And Mr.
        Teske&rsquo;s main objectives&mdash;teaching learners how to think critically, to reflect, to analyze and
        synthesize, to evaluate&mdash;remains unrealized.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">The Importance of Educational Goals (Standards)</h2>
      <div class="single-column">
        <p class="key-point"><strong>Educational goals</strong>&nbsp;are the broad intentions of educational
          systems&mdash;the standards these systems are designed to reach. They describe what educational systems are
          designed to accomplish. They summarize the purposes of educational institutions and, indirectly, the goals that
          societies and parents have for children.</p>
        <p>In much of the educational literature, the word <em>standard</em> is used
          interchangeably with the word <em>goal</em>, as it is in this text.</p>

          <p class="tx">On occasion, however, <em>standard</em> means a level of performance, such as in <em>performing
            to a high standard</em>. Levels of performance are often described in terms of sequential steps that form a <em>learning progression</em>. A learning progression is a hierarchical succession of skills and knowledge
            that build toward a learning objective.</p>
          <p class="tx">The phrases <em>learning objective </em>and <em>instructional objective</em> (and sometimes <em>educational
            objective</em>) are used interchangeably: They denote the more specific objectives of the teaching/learning
            enterprise. A <em>criterion</em> in educational literature is a level of performance to which performance can
            be compared and evaluated. Hence <em>success criteria</em> denote specific criteria associated with desired
            or expected achievement. These important terms are defined and illustrated in Table 1.4</p>

      <p class="key-point">Educational standards (goals) such as those described by ESSA are helpful for guiding the development
        of curricula and influencing the values of educators and perhaps of students and parents as well. In
        fact, one of the most useful approaches to designing a curriculum is to begin with the goals of that
        curriculum&mdash;a process labeled <strong>backward design</strong>. One of the identifying characteristics
        of the backward design process is that learning objectives are derived directly from educational standards.</p>
      <h3>The Process</h3>
      <p><strong>{{Insert Infographic Here}} </strong></p>
      <p>The backward design process can be described in terms of three steps:</p>
      <ol class="nl">
        <li>Decide on the end results (the goals or standards) that the curriculum is intended to achieve (specify
          learning objectives);</li>
        <li>Clarify how you will be able to determine that the desired end results have been reached (plan for
          assessment);</li>
        <li>Select or design instructional activities most likely to lead to desired end results (plan teaching/learning
          approaches).</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>The Role of Assessment</h3>
      <p>Assessment plays a critical role in the backward design process. Not only are
        assessment decisions made even before decisions about teaching and learning activities, but, as Wright (2006)
        points out, assessment results can also influence instructional approaches. This might occur, for example, when
        formative assessments reveal that many learners are struggling to reach learning objectives.</p>
      <p>Assessment results can also influence the goals themselves. For example, if
        assessments indicate that even with the most effective instructional approaches available, learning objectives
        remain out of reach, the objectives themselves might have to be changed.</p>
      <p>Although the backward design model for curriculum building, assessment, and instruction is presented
        as a series of steps, it is, in some ways, a cycle&mdash;as is shown by the arrows in Figure 1.4.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Collaboration in the Assessment Cycle</h2>
      <div class="single-column">
        <p>Following passage of the ESSA, individual states are now required to develop their own educational
          goals (standards), to select assessments that will allow them to determine if these standards are being met, and,
          of course, to provide the kind of education that will maximize the likelihood of reaching these goals. As we see
          later in this chapter, many states have adopted <em>common core standards</em> developed by a national consortium
          of educators. And many also collaborate in developing and sharing relevant assessment and instructional
          materials, often through the formation of what is termed a <strong>professional learning community (PLC)</strong>.</p>
        <h3>What Is a PLC?</h3>
        <p>PLCs are formal associations of educators, and sometimes of parents, who come together
          to collaborate and share ideas and resources relating to all things educational: goals, assessments, learning,
          and teaching. They often include members from different schools and sometimes even from different states.
          PLCs have become increasingly popular in recent decades as educational systems have faced increasing pressure to
          improve educational standards and student performance. They are now common worldwide and often include
          international collaboration (Pang and Wang, 2016).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="customCol-4">
        <p>Issues often faced by PLCs include setting and clarifying specific goals relating to the high
          standards most governments expect of their schools; designing curricula that incorporate these goals; developing
          the assessment procedures that will allow educators and administrators to monitor progress toward the goals; and
          devising and implementing instructional strategies most likely to provide every learner with an opportunity to
          reach desired standards.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="single-column">
        <h3>How Might PLCs Use Backward Design?</h3>
        <p>The backward-design approach provides a highly useful and systematic way to attack
          these issues. As a result, it has become an increasingly popular approach to the cycle of designing
          curricula, developing assessments, and implementing teaching strategies. For example, Paesani (2017), describes
          how a French language curriculum was backwards-designed based on the overarching standard toward which the course
          was aimed, <em>cultural literacy</em>. By relating specific course objectives to this broad concept, explains
          Paesani, educators were able to devise assessment and instructional approaches that greatly increased the
          likelihood that learners would, in fact, develop <em>cultural literacy</em> relating to the French language.</p>
        <p>Backward design approaches to specifying learning objectives, developing assessment programs, and
          planning instruction have also become increasingly prevalent in post-secondary institutions (for example,
          Reynolds and Kearns, 2017; Michael and Libarkin, 2016).</p>
        <h3>How Do Educators Write Specific Instructional Objectives?</h3>
        <p>As we saw, educational goals often take the form of broad, general intentions of educational
          endeavors. They are the <em>standards</em> to which the ESSA refers: &ldquo;ESSA requires that states establish
          college- and career-ready standards and maintain high expectations when assessing all students against those
          standards&rdquo; (U.S. Department of Education, 2017).</p>
        <p>The problem for educators is that standards, such as ESSA&rsquo;s requirement that all learners
          achieve high English language proficiency, are not nearly as helpful in the day-to-day business of teaching as
          are more specific statements of <strong>learning objectives</strong>&mdash;also commonly referred to as <strong>learning
          targets</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>or as <em>instructional objectives</em><strong>. </strong>Learning
          targets describe what the teacher and the student aim to achieve. They are statements of what schools expect
          students to know and be able to do.</p>
        <p>Learning objectives tell the teacher:</p>
        <ul class="bl, checklist">
          <li>What needs to be taught</li>
          <li>What needs to be assessed</li>
          <li>How it will be taught and assessed</li>
        </ul>
        <p> The great value of the backward design approach is that it provides a clear, step-by-step method to
          determining what needs to be taught, how it can be assessed, and how best to assist learners in reaching
          curriculum objectives.</p>
        <p>Learning objectives often take the form of statements about what is expected of students once they
          have completed a lesson, a unit, or perhaps an entire course. The most useful learning objectives
          for teaching and assessment don&rsquo;t describe a lesson or a course but rather spell out the precise
          behaviors or skills that students should be able to perform following instruction. For this reason,
          learning objectives are sometimes called behavioral objectives.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;Consider the following two examples of instructional objectives:</p>
        <ol class="nl">
          <li>The learner should be proficient in mathematics.</li>
          <li>The learner should be able to add two-digit numbers without using computers or other mechanical or electronic
            devices&mdash;and without resorting to fingers or toes.</li>
        </ol>
        <blockquote class="pullquote" id="bq-override-1-5-1">Learning targets = instructional objectives = learning
          objectives = behavioral objectives</blockquote>
        <p>The second of these objectives is more useful than the first because it states what the student must
          be able to do following instruction. As a result, it offers specific guidance for instruction and for assessment.</p>
        <p>Not only do useful instructional objectives specify what the learner should be able to
          do, but they also provide definite criteria for meeting goals. For example, look at these instructional
          objectives:</p>
        <ul class="bl">
          <li>The learner will be able to input material using a blank keyboard.</li>
          <li>On a 5-minute test using a blank keyboard, the learner will be able to input 40 words per minute with no more
            than 3 errors when transcribing a randomly assigned passage from <em>Catcher in the Rye</em>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The second of these statements establishes clear criteria for meeting instructional goals. As a
          result, it is more useful than the first for suggesting instructional and assessment procedures.</p>
        <p>Writing useful learning objectives requires specifying objectives in terms of measurable outcomes.
          This involves all components of the assessment cycle illustrated in Figure 1.5.</p>

      <div class="single-column">
        <p>Although precise, performance-oriented approaches to instructional objectives are most useful for
          guiding instruction and assessment, more general statements of objectives can also be helpful. For example, Waugh
          and Gronlund (2013) suggest that teachers should express main objectives in general rather than specific terms.
          Each main objective can then be developed in terms of actual behaviors that reflect the more general objective.
          Examples of these actual behaviors can then be used as a basis for assessment. (Chapter 4 presents a more
          detailed description of instructional objectives.)</p>

      <p>Among other things, the ESSA sets broad educational goals for all grade levels, makes

        (see Table 1.5 for highlights).</p>
      <p>The ESSA replaced the <strong>No Child Left Behind Act</strong>, or <strong>NCLB</strong>(2002) which
        had similar goals for children but far more stringent assessment requirements. For example, under NCLB, all
        students were expected to pass end-of-year tests, a clearly unrealistic expectation.</p>
      <p>Also, NCLB required that each state develop its own tests; under ESSA, states are free to use
        nationally recognized tests such as the ACT and the SAT (both of which are standardized tests widely used for
        admission to college.)</p>

    <div class="right-column">
      <p>One of the general requirements mandated by ESSA is that all states develop high academic standards,
        provide an opportunity for all learners to reach these goals, and develop assessments to monitor the extent to
        which goals are being reached. One of the results of this legislation has been an increased
        emphasis on <em>common </em>standards within and even across states.</p>
      <p>Common standards help ensure equity in education across states and prevent fragmentation of education
        for those students who move to new communities that might otherwise have their own unique standards&mdash;an
        increasingly common event in a mobile population.</p>
      <p>The <strong>Common Core State Standards</strong>&mdash;first introduced across the country in 2009,
        well before the passage of ESSA in 2015&mdash;is one such example of a nationwide effort to develop standards.</p>

      <div class="box-6">
        <h3 class="h3">The Development of Common Core</h3>
        <p class="tx">As part of an increasingly global society, students must compete against people from around the
          world for jobs. They need to have the knowledge, skills, and disposition to be successful in this changing
          world&mdash;skills such as those involved in collaboration, critical thinking, communication, creativity, and
          innovation.</p>
        <p class="tx">As leaders across the country considered these issues, many recognized the need to move beyond
          individual state standards for learning. They concluded that states need to agree on common standards in
          education that allow all children to develop the skills and knowledge required for success in a global
          society, regardless of where they live.</p>
        <p class="tx">Two organizations, the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) and the National Governors
          Association Center for Best Practices, spearheaded a movement to bring state leaders, administrators,
          teachers, and other stakeholders together to design standards that are rigorous, innovative, and focused on
          the most important knowledge and skills required for today&rsquo;s students.</p>
        <p class="tx">The Common Core State Standards initiative sought feedback from parents, teachers, state leaders,
          and the general public. The standards were finalized in 2010 and revised again in 2017 InTASC Model Core
          Teaching Standards, 2017). States were invited to adopt the Common Core Standards, but the choice remains
          voluntary.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <div class="right-column">
      <p>For kindergarten through 12th grade, Common Core Standards have been developed in the disciplines of <a class="link" href="#tip1-5" data-type="tipTrigger">English/Language Arts</a> and <a class="link" href="#tip1-6"
            data-type="tipTrigger">Mathmatics</a>. These content areas were chosen due to the foundational aspect of these
        subjects. The Common Core Standards are focused on establishing a balance between content knowledge and thinking
        skills.</p>
    </div>
    <section class="tipBox" id="tip1-5">
      <div class="box-6">
        <h3 class="h3">English/Language Arts</h3>
        <p class="tx">In English/Language Arts, the standards are organized so that reading, writing, listening and
          speaking, and language cross all grade levels with technology embedded in each component. Students are
          expected to read a variety of fiction and nonfiction genres from both print and nonprint sources and to think
          critically about the content of the reading. Even at the lower grade levels, they are encouraged to form
          opinions and support them, and to develop writing skills for different purposes. Under the Common Core
          Standards, students have multiple opportunities to engage in dialogue in a variety of arenas, formal and
          informal, as they practice both listening and speaking skills.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section class="tipBox" id="tip1-6">
      <div class="box-6">
        <h3 class="h3">Mathematics</h3>
        <p class="tx">Similar to the English/Language Arts Standards, Mathematics Standards require students to employ
          higher levels of thinking. In a global society, it is not enough that students master procedures for doing
          calculations&mdash;termed <em>procedural </em>knowledge. In addition to procedural knowledge, they need to be
          able to reason mathematically, solve problems, and use logic to deduce answers. They also need to be able to
          communicate their mathematical thinking and justify their answers and solutions. Standards that attend to
          both procedural competence and conceptual understanding equip students with the ability to assess a
          situation, determine a plan of action, carry out that plan, and evaluate its effectiveness.</p>
        <p class="tx">The Common Core Standards present a framework that can help unify the content knowledge and
          thinking skills students will need in the 21st century. As states adopt these standards, they are helping to
          ensure that all students have a high-quality education focused on knowledge and skills required of a
          contributing member of today&rsquo;s society.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <div class="right-column">
      <p>As of 2016, 42 states had adopted the standards, often with minor changes (Korn, Gamboa, &amp;
        Polikoff, 2016). However, as more states adopt the Common Core Standards, potential obstacles are beginning to
        appear.</p>
      <p>One of these has to do with the costs of changing assessment systems and reporting
        student progress. Older methods of assessment tended to focus on recall and recognition. But because new
        standards attempt to foster critical thinking and problem solving, new assessments need to be developed.</p>
      <p>In addition, teachers who have operated with standards that focus on discrete knowledge
        need to develop new tools for instruction. Specifically, they must develop materials that engage students
        in problems that do not always have a clear, correct answer. It is yet to be determined when these issues will be
        addressed and who will cover the costs.</p>
    </div>
    <div style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</div>
  </div>
  <h2 class="h2">Use of Data Analytics</h2>
  <div class="single-column">
    <p>With the passage of ESSA, there is clearly less emphasis on standardized testing and on what is
      termed <em>high-stakes testing</em>&mdash;testing with potentially significant</p>
    <p>implications (see Chapter 10). However, there is still a need for teachers, schools,
      and states to deliver the best educational experiences possible for their charges.</p>
    <p>Tests serve an important function in this regard: They provide numerical data that can
      be analyzed, sorted, transformed, and otherwise manipulated to reveal key insights&mdash;a process that defines <strong>data analytics</strong>.</p>
    <p>The emphasis in data analytics&mdash;as opposed to data <em>analysis&mdash;</em>is on using
      information for decision making. Data analytics in education uses statistics (see Chapter 9), computer programs,
      learning theories, and information from educational research in an effort to improve teaching and learning. </p>

<section class="tipBox" id="tip1-7">
  <div class="box-6">
    <h3 class="h3">Applications: Making Data-Driven Decisions</h3>
    <p class="tx">Data-driven decision making is a concept gaining wide acceptance from educators, parents, and
      policy makers. It involves using evidence, or data, to demonstrate that a decision or action is the best
      among available alternatives.</p>
    <p class="tx"><strong><em>Avoiding Subjective Feelings</em></strong></p>
    <p class="tx">In the past, schools have been known to operate on &ldquo;gut feelings.&rdquo; The teacher <em>feels</em> that students benefit when instruction is combined with music. The principal <em>believes</em> the reading
      program is the best for the school. The board of education <em>thinks</em> that eliminating recess will
      improve test scores because more instructional time is available.</p>
    <p class="tx">However, with the obligation to prepare students for the 21st century and the goal for students
      to flourish in a global society, we can no longer &ldquo;feel,&rdquo; &ldquo;believe,&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;think&rdquo;: We need to know. With data-driven decision making, teachers conduct action research
      within their classes to determine if music truly does benefit students. Principals and boards of education
      read the research that has been done or systematically investigate a given topic so they have data on which
      to base their decisions.</p>
    <p class="tx"><strong><em>Supplying Evidence</em></strong></p>
    <p class="tx">Consider this scenario: A local school has received its test scores from a statewide assessment
      of science in the third grade. The principal has shared the results and asked the third-grade team to review
      the data. They lay out the individual teacher&rsquo;s results and start looking for patterns. They consult
      the assessments blueprints and determine that across the four classes, one strand from the science curriculum
      is problematic. All four classes did poorly on the Interrelationships in Earth/Space Systems strand.</p>
    <p class="tx">They discuss why this might have occurred and discover that for all the other science strands,
      they have ample supplemental teaching materials. However, for this strand they are limited to their textbook
      for teaching the concepts in the state&rsquo;s standards. Armed with these data, they suggest to their
      principal that not only do they need more materials, but they also need training to use the materials.
      Without data to support their request, their case would be far less convincing.</p>
    <p class="tx"><strong><em>Supplying Sufficient Evidence</em></strong></p>
    <p class="tx">&nbsp;However, as compelling as some evidence may be, it is important to exercise caution when
      employing data-driven decision making.</p>
    <p class="tx">For example, one data set is not enough. The third-grade teachers could strengthen their case by
      including further evidence that the Science strand is problematic. What has been the performance of the
      students during the actual science unit? Do their scores on quizzes and tests reflect the same low scores
      seen on the statewide assessment? Do the informal checks for understanding conducted while teaching indicate
      confusion and misconceptions?</p>
    <p class="tx">Quality data-driven decision making does not rely on a single data set from which to draw
      conclusions.</p>
    <p class="tx"><strong><em>Drawing Conclusions</em></strong></p>
    <p class="tx">In addition, having the data does not does not guarantee the best decision.</p>
    <p class="tx">In the third-grade scenario, the data point to a problem with the one Science strand. The
      teachers provide the evidence to their principal, hoping that she will reach the same conclusion they
      have&mdash;more materials and training are needed.</p>
    <p class="tx">Instead, the principal might decide to increase the amount of instructional time for this unit.
      Rather than spending just two weeks on this unit, she decides teachers should spend four weeks, stealing time
      from the two units that surround this one in the curriculum pacing guide.</p>
    <p class="tx">Was the decision based on data? Yes. Was it a good one? We&rsquo;ll have to wait to see what the
      later data reveal. Data-driven decision making has the potential of anchoring decisions to evidence. However,
      just like with most things, potential is not always reached.</p>

    <h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Question</span> <span class="focus_q">What are some ways
      legislation has created a high-stakes learning environment?</span></h2>
  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
    <p class="intro">Among other things, legislation such as the Every Student Succeeds Act, seeks to make
      teachers and schools more accountable. One way of doing this is to specify what the goals of education are
      and to lay out minimum educational standards that will be acceptable as criteria for reaching these goals.
      An educational standard is basically a description of a required or expected level of knowledge or performance.</p>
    <p>Another way of encouraging schools and teachers to be more accountable is to tie funding directly to
      the performance of students, of schools, and, by the same token, of teachers. Educational standards described in
      ESSA have to do with attaining proficiency in reading and mathematics, becoming proficient in English, graduating
      from high school, and being taught by highly qualified teachers.</p>
    <p>How can you tell if all students have reached the required standards? The simple answer
      is by using tests. As we see in Chapter 10, these tests can have very high stakes indeed, because their
      consequences can be life changing for students, determining whether or not they pass or fail, can or cannot enter
      a post-secondary program, receive or do not receive a scholarship. They can also be system changing, especially
      if federal funds are tied to how well students perform on these tests.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section-body">
    <h2 class="h2">Remembering NCLB</h2>
    <div class="single-column">
      <p>Under the older NCLB Act, states were required to set yearly performance targets with a view to
        reaching certain levels of proficiency within the allotted period. Performance on high-stakes standardized tests
        provided information for <em>data analytic</em> processing, the results of which then allowed the U.S. Department
        of Education to determine how every public school in the country was performing. The consequences of not making
        what was deemed <strong>adequate yearly progress (AYP)</strong>&nbsp;were spelled out by the NCLB Act. These
        included the possibility of replacing staff, hiring outside consultants, or even transferring administrative
        responsibilities to outside personnel.</p>
      <p>With the replacement of the NCLB with ESSA, the notion of AYP is no longer relevant. Although
        schools are still expected to be accountable and to reach certain standards, they are no longer subject to the
        same testing procedures or punitive possibilities as was previously the case (Walker, 2015).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="inner-section">
      <h2 class="h2">Assessing Teacher Competence</h2>
      <div class="single-column">
        <p>Also potentially very high stakes are the tests used to assess teacher competence.
          A variety of tests are available including the <em>edTPA </em>(which stands for Teacher Performance Assessment),
          developed by the Stanford University Center for Assessment, Learning, and Equity (SCALE), and the Praxis&trade;
          tests created by <strong>Educational Testing Service (ETS)</strong>, a nonprofit organization that develops and
          oversees a variety of national and international tests.</p>
        <p>The Praxis&trade; tests are based on 10 basic principles that describe the skills, attitudes, and
          behaviors thought to be characteristic of the most effective teachers (Table 1.x). The standards of effective
          teachers and teaching outlined in Table 1.x were developed by a consortium of school administrators, the Council
          of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), and are known as the InTASC principles. InTASC stands for Interstate
          Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium (InTASC model core teaching standards: A resource for state dialogue,
          2017).</p>
        <p>Many teacher-training institutions use a form of this test, the Praxis I&trade;, as a basis for
          admission to their teacher-training program. It is designed to assess whether candidates have minimum levels of
          competence in basic skills such as reading, writing, and arithmetic.</p>
        <p>A second form of the test, the Praxis II&trade;, looks at subject matter knowledge and related
          teaching skills. The Praxis II&trade; is sometimes a requirement for teacher certification.</p>
        <p>A third form of the test, the Praxis III&trade;, may also be used to determine readiness for full
          teacher certification. It assesses aspects of the teachers&rsquo; actual classroom performance. Unlike the Praxis
          I&trade; and the Praxis II&trade;, which are almost exclusively computer delivered tests, the Praxis III&trade;
          uses trained examiners who interview teachers and observe them in their classrooms. Praxis I and II&trade; exams
          are scheduled at specific times and places and require payment of fees. Yearly schedules for testing times and
          locations are available online (for example, Teachers Test Prep, 2018).</p>

    <h2 class="h2">Remembering Race to the Top (R2T)</h2>
    <div class="single-column">
      <p>Announced in 2009, the Race to the Top program was a federally funded ($4.35 billion) competition for
        funds. It ended five years later and gave rise to considerable controversy while it was in effect.</p>
      <p>The R2T funding program was based on the principle of teacher and school accountability. Under this
        program, funds were awarded to school jurisdictions based on points earned for demonstrating performance-based
        standards, complying with national educational standards, promoting charter schools, and encouraging the use of
        computers in classrooms. The points received reflected such things as the competence of teachers and principals,
        the effectiveness of preparation programs for teachers and principals, progress in raising school achievement,
        and the development of high-quality assessment procedures designed to reflect increasingly high standards.</p>
      <p>The Race to the Top funding program was designed to bring about educational reforms in the areas of
        standards, assessments, teacher qualifications, and low-achieving schools.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="customCol-1">
      <p>One effect of the R2T funding program was that a large number of U.S. states adopted
        common standards reflecting the InTASC standards developed by the Council of Chief State School Officers;
        others developed their own standards. A second outcome was that many states encouraged the formation of more <strong>charter schools</strong>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="single-column">
      <p>However, the Race to the Top funding program was highly controversial. Because only some states
        &ldquo;won&rdquo; this funding competition, many of those that &ldquo;lost&rdquo; incurred significant additional
        expenses without seeing any corresponding increase in educational funding. As a result, many states did not apply
        for R2T funding or later opted out of the program. In the end, 11 states and the District of Columbia were
        granted R2T funds ranging from $75 million to $700 million each.</p>
      <p>After the funding period had expired in 2015, an evaluation of the program concluded that there had
        been improvements in the four areas of primary concern: higher educational standards; development of assessment
        procedures designed to improve learning and instruction; enhanced teacher qualifications; and measurable
        increases in the achievement levels of lower-performing schools (U.S. Department of Education, 2015). For
        example, as shown in Figure 1.6, graduation rates in all Race to the Top states combined showed a trend of steady
        improvement over the four years from 2010 to 2014.</p>

    <h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Question</span> <span class="focus_q">What is IDEA, and what is its
      implications for educational assessment?</span></h2>
  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
    <p class="key-point, intro">With the passage of a series of federal laws revised in 2004 and culminating in what is now commonly
      referred to as <strong>IDEA</strong> (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the education of children with
      special needs has increasingly become one of the responsibilities of regular classroom teachers. This act has had
      important implications for the assessment of children with special needs.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section-body">
    <div class="single-column">
      <p>IDEA gave most of the responsibility for identifying and providing services for
        children with special needs to special education teachers&nbsp;(teachers specifically trained and charged with
        looking after children with special needs). But the provisions of the Individuals with Disabilities Education
        Improvement Act, together with a series of related court decisions, have been largely instrumental in
        revolutionizing how schools assess and deal with exceptionality.</p>
      <p>{{Insert Image 1.2 Here-- A young Caucasian boy with Down&rsquo;s syndrome smiles as he raises his
        hand.}}</p>
      <p>Among other things, the law provides important guarantees for children with exceptionalities and
        their parents (Center for Appropriate Dispute Resolution, 2010). The guarantees include</p>
      <ul class="bl, checklist">
        <li>Zero rejection and mandated parent participation</li>
        <li>Education in the &ldquo;least restrictive environment&rdquo;</li>
        <li>Free and appropriate educational services</li>
        <li>Fair, nondiscriminatory assessment and due process of law</li>
        <li>An individualized education plan (IEP)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Although these guarantees were initially intended to apply to learners with special
        needs, they are increasingly being applied to all learners. As a result, it is important for all teachers and
        educational authorities to understand the implications of IDEA.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="inner-section">
      <h2 class="h2">Zero Rejection and Mandated Parent Participation</h2>
      <div class="single-column">
        <p><em>All</em> children, no matter how severe their disabilities, are entitled to all the provisions
          of the act. That is, each child is entitled to education in the least restrictive environment, to
          nondiscriminatory assessment, to all required educational services at no cost, and to an individualized
          education plan.</p>
        <p>The guarantee of parent participation grants parents the right to participate in meaningful ways in
          all aspects of their child&rsquo;s education including assessment, development of individual education plans,
          school placement, and transition from school.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2 class="h2">Education in the Least Restrictive Environment</h2>
    <div class="single-column">
      <p>Certain precedent-setting legal decisions have specified that children with disabilities have the
        right to education in the least restrictive environment. This is usually interpreted to mean a regular
        classroom as opposed to one designated as a &ldquo;special education&rdquo; classroom. This interpretation has
        led directly to the practice of <strong>mainstreaming,</strong>or <strong>inclusion</strong>, of children with
        special needs in the regular classroom.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="inner-section">
      <h2 class="h2">Free and Appropriate Public Education (FAPE)</h2>
      <div class="single-column">
        <p>Children with special needs must be given optimal educational experiences at public expense.
          Optimal or appropriate educational experiences are typically guided by a detailed education plan developed by
          parents, teachers, and other specialists specifically for each child.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2 class="h2">Fair Evaluation and Due Process</h2>
    <div class="single-column">
      <p>IDEA requires that the identification of children with special needs, and the detailed analysis of
        their needs, be based on a variety of relevant and appropriate assessment procedures. Parents and teachers are
        usually the first to notice that a child might have special needs. IDEA mandates that subsequent assessment be
        undertaken by trained professionals using nondiscriminatory procedures. One of the practical implications of
        this guarantee is that assessment for learners whose primary language is not English must take place in their
        native language.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="inner-section">
      <h2 class="h2">Individualized Education Plans (IEPs)</h2>
      <div class="single-column">
        <p> <strong>Individualized education plans (IEPs)</strong>&nbsp;are written programs that are required
          by law for every child with special needs. They are usually prepared by a team that includes the child&rsquo;s
          parents, regular classroom teachers, special education teachers, and one or more specialists as required. On
          occasion, the child might also be involved in developing an IEP.</p>
        <p>IDEA specifies that IEPs must be written documents that contain the following:</p>
        <ul class="bl, checklist">
          <li>A clear description of the student&rsquo;s current performance and achievement</li>
          <li>A list of short-range objectives and of longer term goals</li>
          <li>A detailed description of the special services that will be provided for the student</li>
          <li>The duration of the program</li>
          <li>Assessment procedures that will be used to evaluate the extent to which goals are being met</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="tx">Developing detailed IEPs can be enormously challenging and time-consuming. And carrying out the
          provisions of these plans&mdash;including assessing the extent to which goals are being met and modifying
          approaches and goals as required&mdash;can be even more challenging.</p>

      <p>According to some critics, Mr. Lowen&rsquo;s approach is one of the by-products of high-stakes
        testing. This would be evident, for example, if Mr. Lowen takes a list of vocabulary words directly from a
        high-stakes state test and teaches only these words and no others to his students to guarantee that they will
        score well on the test. That illustrates teaching to the test in its negative sense.</p>
      <p>In contrast, a teacher might approach vocabulary development in a reading class by helping students
        find and learn new words in hard-to-read texts. That would be teaching to the test in its more positive sense,
        although it might not guarantee test marks quite as high.</p>
      <p>As we see in Chapter 10, when there is a great deal of pressure on teachers to have
        their students perform well, and when the consequences of doing so&mdash;or of not doing so&mdash;are massive,
        instructional and assessment decisions might suffer.</p>
      <p>Note, however, that with the replacement of NCLB with ESSA, the use of high-stakes tests has
        diminished and, consequently, the pressure to &ldquo;teach to the test&rdquo; is no longer as urgent.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="inner-section">
      <h2 class="h2">The Problem of Bias</h2>
      <div class="single-column">
        <p>Unfortunately, the unethical use of tests is not limited to teachers coaching their students on
          high-stakes tests. Another misuse involves standardized tests that are biased against certain
          populations and groups.</p>
        <p>For example, there is considerable evidence that children of ethnic minorities are underrepresented
          in the field of giftedness (Liu and Waller, 2018). This bias has sometimes been attributed to selection
          procedures that depend on teacher identification of likely candidates. It may also be related to the use of
          standardized tests that have racial bias built into them.</p>
      </div>
      <figure class="photo-right"> <img src="Images/landscape2.jpg" alt="sample photo" title="sample photo">
        <figcaption>
          <p class="cr">iStock/Getty Images</p>
          <p class="caption">One goal of the NCLB is that all students attain proficiency in reading and mathematics. But
            note that state-defined standards of proficiency do not imply that all students have to be pointed toward
            nuclear physics or rocket science.</p>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <div class="single-column">
        <p>Racial bias in tests may result from the fact that they were developed for majority cultural groups.
          But, as Shuttleworth-Edwards (2016) points out, tests may also be biased when they were developed and normed with
          a huge multicultural population&mdash;as might be the case for tests developed in the U. S., for example.</p>
        <p>These tests, explains Shuttleworth-Edwards, may <em>generally</em> represent an entire population
          but, because it is multi-cultural, the tests might not be a fair measure for any one of the minority cultures
          that make up the population. They might be biased against some students and unduly favor others.</p>
        <p>The adoption of common standards and assessment procedures in an increasing number of states has led
          many to hope that long-standing cultural differences in achievement&mdash;and perhaps in opportunity as
          well&mdash;may be reduced. As Worrell and Jacobson (2016) suggest, the appropriate use of test scores, as well as
          the use of appropriate tests, may go some distance toward that goal.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2 class="h2">Guidelines for the Appropriate Use of Tests</h2>
    <div class="single-column">
      <p>There are now guidelines for teachers such as Mr. Lowen, whose assessment practices are less than
        ideal.</p>
      <p>One set of guidelines is that developed by the Code of Fair Practices in Education
        (2004), a group made up of representatives from the American Psychological Association (APA), the American
        Counseling Association (ACA), the American Educational Research Association (AERA), the American
        Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA), the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP), the National
        Association of Test Directors (NATD), and the National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME).</p>
      <p>The resulting set of guidelines, called the Code of Fair Testing Practices in
        Education, is intended to apply to all kinds of educational assessment including paper-and-pencil tests,
        computer-based tests, and performance tests. It is designed to provide guidance for test developers as well
        as those who use tests. It lists specific recommendations with respect to the following areas:</p>
      <ul class="bl">
        <li>Developing and selecting appropriate tests</li>
        <li>Administering and scoring tests</li>
        <li>Reporting and interpreting test results</li>
        <li>Informing test takers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Given its importance, the code is reprinted in its entirety in Table 2.3 (Chapter 2). Much of the
        information in the part of the table that deals with fair testing practices for <em>test users</em> is especially
        relevant for classroom teachers and school administrators. The part that deals with the responsibilities of test
        developers is most relevant for professional test-development companies, although it too has implications for
        many kinds of teacher-made tests (discussed in Chapter 8).</p>
      <p>Most educational and psychological organizations also have other codes that specify what
        ethical&mdash;and unethical&mdash;behavior is for their members (e.g., the <em>Code of Ethics</em> of the
        American Educational Research Association, 2011).</p>

        <h3 class="h3">Ethical Principles for Educational Assessment</h3>
        <ul class="bl, checklist">
          <li>Some ethical principles most relevant for educational assessment include the following:</li>
          <li>No testing procedure should be undertaken where there is a possibility of harming participants physically
            or emotionally;</li>
          <li>When assessments are part of a research project, informed consent of participants is generally mandatory.
            That is, participants must understand the implications and possible consequences of the assessment and must
            be free to refuse without coercion or fear of reprisal. By definition, being a student in school or college
            constitutes implied consent with respect to normal educational testing procedures;</li>
          <li>Steps should be taken to ensure that test results as well as individual responses remain anonymous;</li>
          <li>Test records must be kept private or disclosed only within the provisions of the law;</li>
          <li>Caution and good sense need to be used if the results of standardized psychological tests (intelligence
            or personality tests for example) are to be shared with students or parents. Given the limited reliability
            of many of these tests, and given the implications of the labels often attached to their results, these
            should not always be fully disclosed;</li>
          <li>Tests need to be as valid, reliable, fair, and unbiased as possible (see Chapter 2);</li>
          <li>The use of deception in psychological research is justified only when the study has significant potential
            value, no alternative methods are readily available, there is minimal risk to participants, and the
            research has been approved by an ethical review board.</li>
        </ul>

    </secition>
    <div class="inner-section">
      <h2 class="h2">Teacher Responsibilities</h2>
      <div class="single-column">
        <p>Without a doubt, teachers have important responsibilities relating to assessment. These include
          choosing or developing assessments that are appropriate for <em>what</em> as well as for <em>whom</em> they are
          intended.</p>
        <p>This means that assessment instruments, procedures, and strategies need to reflect
          intended instructional goals and that they must also be free of cultural, social class, or religious bias.</p>
        <p>When required, assessments must also be appropriate for learners with special needs.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="single-column">
        <h3>Testing Fairly</h3>
        <p>As we see in Chapter 2, one of the most important characteristics of educational assessments from
          the student&rsquo;s point of view is that they be fair&mdash;or at least seem to the learner to be fair. That
          chapter also describes how assessments need to be valid (their interpretations and uses must be supported by
          evidence), and they need to measure as accurately and consistently as possible (they need to be reliable). An
          important aspect of the teacher&rsquo;s responsibilities with respect to assessment is to ensure that
          assessment procedures be as fair, valid, and reliable as possible.</p>
        <h3>Scoring and Using Results</h3>
        <p>Teachers also have key responsibilities relating to scoring, interpreting, reporting, and using the
          results of assessment procedures (Chapter 11). Scoring and interpreting a test should be accurate and unbiased.
          Further, the results of a single assessment should never be the basis for major decisions.</p>
        <h3>Communicating Results</h3>
        <p>Finally, teachers are responsible for communicating assessment results to students, parents, and
          administration. It is important that they understand the limitations and significance of their assessments. And
          it is also important that they help learners and parents interpret test results and understand their meaning.</p>

    <h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Question</span> <span class="focus_q">What rights do students have
      with regard to assessment and their education?</span></h2>
  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
    <p class="intro">Students, too, have responsibilities with respect to schooling and assessment&mdash;and rights as
      well. Among their responsibilities are obvious requirements, such as showing up in school or examination rooms at
      the appointed place and time; acquiring educational materials as needed; making an honest effort to participate
      and learn; and being honest and ethical in the completion of assignments and in test taking, avoiding plagiarism,
      and other forms of cheating.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section-body">
    <h2 class="h2">The Right to an Education</h2>
    <div class="single-column">
      <p>Student rights vary considerably throughout the world. As we saw earlier, ESSA and IDEA
        specify that in the United States, all students have the right to a &ldquo;free and appropriate&rdquo;
        education, to be taught by highly qualified teachers, and to be taught in such a way that all will reach a
        minimum level of proficiency in reading, writing, and arithmetic and all will graduate from high school.</p>
      <p>Although the probability that all students will fulfill these ideals is unrealistic, that each should
        have a legitimate opportunity to do so is really the most important goal.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="inner-section">
      <h2 class="h2">The Right to Assembly and Expression</h2>
      <div class="single-column">
        <p>Within certain legal limits, students in U.S. schools also have rights relating to freedom of
          expression and of assembly. And in the event of a grievance, they have a right to due process of law.</p>
        <p>A declaration of school students&rsquo; rights adopted by the general assembly of the Organizing
          Bureau of European School Student Unions (OBESSU) also stipulates that all students should have a right to</p>
        <ul class="bl, checklist">
          <li>a legally recognized school council</li>
          <li>participate in important school decisions including the content of lectures, selection of texts, and teaching
            methods</li>
          <li>appeal decisions they deem unfavorable</li>
          <li>all normal civil rights</li>
          <li>high-quality education (The Declaration of School Student Rights, 2014).</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <figure class="photo-left"> <img src="Images/landscape3.jpg" alt="samle photo" title="sample photo">
        <figcaption>
          <p class="cr">iStock/Getty Images Plus</p>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <div class="right-column">
        <p>Similar rights are expressed in the Student Bill of Rights adopted by the United States Student
          Association (United States Student Association, 2012). The rights most commonly described in student bills of
          rights include the rights to free expression, safety and well-being, due process, personal learning, and privacy.
          Also often included are statements regarding the right to employability, civic participation, inclusion, fair
          assessment, and preparation for technology (Martin, 2015). Some of these rights are discussed below.</p>
        <p>Recently, too, there has been increasing emphasis on privacy laws, many of which guarantee the
          individual&rsquo;s right to confidentiality with respect to personal information. Determining whether this also
          includes test results is an important issue for educators.</p>
      </div>
      <div style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</div>
    </div>
    <h2 class="h2">The Right to Privacy</h2>
    <div class="single-column">
      <p>The <strong>Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)</strong>&nbsp;is the U.S. federal law
        which protects the student&rsquo;s right to privacy (U.S. Department of Education, 2018). Its main provisions are
        the following:</p>
      <ul class="bl">
        <li>It gives students access to their education records.</li>
        <li>It provides an opportunity for students to petition to have records changed if they think these are unfair or
          inaccurate.</li>
        <li>It grants students some control over the disclosure of personal information from these records.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="customCol-1">
      <p>In practice, what the law means is that schools typically require written permission
        from students or their parents (or other adults legally responsible for them) to release to a third party any
        &ldquo;protected&rdquo; information from student records (&ldquo;third party&rdquo; does not include the
        student or the student&rsquo;s parents).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="single-column">
      <h3>Protected Information</h3>
      <p>Protected information includes educational information, directory information, and
        personally identifiable information, each of which is subject to different limitations. For example,
        personally identifiable information can only be disclosed after obtaining a signed document (from the parent or
        student if the student is over 18) that specifies to whom the information will be released and for what purpose.</p>
      <p>In contrast, release of directory information, such as a list of student names and phone numbers, is
        not normally considered an invasion of privacy and is permitted under FERPA. However, the disclosure of this type
        of information is subject to the student&rsquo;s or caregiver&rsquo;s right to prohibit it (Hlavac and Easterly,
        2015).</p>
      <h3>Formal Records Versus Informal Grading</h3>
      <p>This law applies to formal school records; however, it does not apply to informal
        grading in school. For example, a fourth-grade teacher is not in violation of privacy rights when he hangs
        an informal chart indicating the number of assignments turned in, or adheres stars on the chart to indicate how
        well the assignments were done.</p>
      <p>Yet he would be in violation of privacy laws if he reported how Joshua did on his arithmetic test to,
        say, his Aunt Miri&mdash;unless she is his &ldquo;authorized representative&rdquo; as defined by the act (usually
        a parent or legal guardian), or unless the parents or legal guardians have granted express and informed consent
        that she be given that information.</p>
      <p>And if Joshua were 18 or more, teachers and postsecondary educators would be in violation of his
        legal right to privacy were they to divulge, even to a parent, any protected information in his records without
        his consent.</p>
      <h3>Other Appropriate Uses of Information</h3>
      <p>The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act does not require that school records, test results, and
        other private information be available only to teachers, school administrators, parents, and students. The
        law also stipulates that student information may be used for funding applications, research, or other
        legitimate purposes as long as a student identifier system protecting the individual identity of each student
        is used.</p>
      <p>The results of various student assessments sometimes need to be shared among other individuals and
        institutions for what are considered legally defensible&mdash;and sometimes legally mandated&mdash;purposes. For
        example, educating children under the mandates of IDEA often requires that information that might otherwise be
        considered private and confidential be shared at least among all who are involved in developing individualized
        education plans (IEPs) for those children. That doing so is legitimate and legally defensible seems clear.</p>
      <p>Sometimes less clear are the privacy rights surrounding the identification of children with special
        needs. Whenever someone is identified as being in need of special educational services, that person&rsquo;s
        record is essentially being flagged and brought to the attention of a variety of people. This practice might have
        serious, life-changing consequences for the individual involved, and it might also be a violation of that
        person&rsquo;s privacy rights. Schools need to be especially mindful of the possibility of misidentifying and
        mislabeling children.</p>
      <h3>Informed Consent</h3>
      <p><em> Informed consent</em> implies three conditions:</p>
      <ul class="bl, checklist">
        <li>that parents (or mature students) be fully informed about why and how personal information will be collected
          and used, or how and why research will be conducted;</li>
        <li>that they have the capacity to refuse to participate or to accept; and</li>
        <li>that accepting or refusing be entirely voluntary without fear of penalty or reprisal.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The notion of informed consent is especially relevant in educational and psychological research, much
        of which involves learners of different ages and characteristics. With respect to such research, both children
        and their parents have the right to be fully informed regarding the research. Furthermore, investigators must
        obtain both the child&rsquo;s consent and the written permission of the parents or legal guardians.</p>

    <h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Question</span> <span class="focus_q">What is a self-regulated
      learner?</span></h2>
  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
    <p class="intro">When we&rsquo;re children, our parents tell us how smart and nimble we are. They smile and clap their
      hands and say, &ldquo;Wow, you speak so well!&rdquo; It makes us proud 3-year-olds, and it reinforces the
      behaviors they praise.</p>
    <p>Later when we go to school, teachers tell us how clever and witty we are. They mark our tests and
      clap their hands and say, &ldquo;Wow! You draw such nice pictures . . . Oh, wait a minute, they&rsquo;re not so
      good, your number skills.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>And somewhere along the road we ask ourselves, &ldquo;How ethical and moral am I?&rdquo; &ldquo;How
      agile and alert?&rdquo; &ldquo;How bright?&rdquo; Gradually, we learn to look at our behaviors, at our small
      accomplishments, at our failures. We discover how to compare our actions, our gifts, our failings, to those of
      others. We develop notions of how things should be or how we would like them to be. We build up personal
      standards that we can now use to become judges of our own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
    <p>Thus, gradually, we learn the skills of <strong>self-assessment</strong>&mdash;the skills that allow
      us to evaluate our own abilities and accomplishments. Self-assessment is a fundamental aspect of
      learning how to learn. It is a cognitive strategy of the utmost importance. Self-assessment is fundamental
      to improvement.</p>
    <p>In the same way that athletes have to be able to evaluate their performance to improve it, learners
      have to know how well or how badly their cognitive processes are functioning in order to get better.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section-body">
    <h2 class="h2">Self-Regulated Learners</h2>
    <div class="single-column">
      <p class="key-point">One of the important goals of schools is to teach students how to learn, to make of them <strong>self-regulated
        learners</strong>&mdash;learners who are autonomous in that:</p>
      <ul class="bl, checklist">
        <li>they take responsibility for setting their own learning objectives,</li>
        <li>they select and apply strategies to reach them, and</li>
        <li>they are able to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of their efforts.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Being a self-regulated learner requires developing the skills of <strong>metacognition&mdash;</strong>knowing
        about knowing (see Chapter 3). Metacognitive skills provide learners with ways of estimating the effects of their
        efforts, of developing strategies for learning and remembering, of problem solving, and of self-assessment.
        Research supports the notion that strong self-assessment skills contribute to effective learning (e.g., Maxlow,
        2017; Sharma et al., 2016).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="inner-section">
      <h2 class="h2">The Bases of Self-Assessment</h2>
      <div class="single-column">
        <p>Students&rsquo; self-assessments&mdash;their personal notions about their progress and achievements,
          and about their strengths and weaknesses&mdash;are based on a number of different factors.</p>
        <p>For example, the information learners receive from peers and teachers about how well
          they are performing invariably colors their self-assessments. Some of this information is derived from the
          formal and informal assessment procedures that schools and teachers provide.</p>
        <p>In addition, comparisons that students make between themselves and others is also a
          rich source of information about self-competence. Self-assessments may reflect a range of sometimes subtle
          influences, including personality characteristics. Some people are naturally confident, possess high opinions of
          themselves, and have a strong sense of their ability to succeed. Others, not so much.</p>
        <p>{{Insert Image1.4 Here-- African American boy studying}}</p>
        <p>One purpose of educational assessment is to foster the skills involved in self-assessment. Some
          students learn and use those skills exceptionally well; they have realistic appraisals of their abilities and
          their weaknesses, and they use their self-appraisals wisely to guide their efforts. Others are prone to
          self-assessments that exaggerate their gifts&mdash;or that depreciate them. Do those of us afflicted with poor
          self-assessment skills ever learn that we do not really know ourselves? That we really are far more gifted than
          we believe? Or&mdash;surely not&mdash;less?</p>

      Education?</span></h1>
    <h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Question</span> <span class="focus_q">What works in the classroom?</span></h2>
  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
    <p class="intro">There is no simple answer to what works in education. Historically, there have been a wide range of
      beliefs about what learning is and a sometimes bewildering assortment of recommendations about the best ways to
      go about the teaching/learning process. A huge amount of research has been undertaken to assess the value of
      these many recommendations. Although the results of this research have not always been clear and without
      controversy, recent summaries and analyses of this research have begun to answer the question, <em>What works</em>?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section-body">
    <h2 class="h2">Formative Assessment and Feedback Work</h2>
    <div class="single-column">
      <p>What works, research informs us, is assessment that is designed <em>for</em> learning rather than
        simply <em>of </em>learning. It is assessment that is conducted <em>for</em> learners rather than simply <em>to</em> learners. In brief, it is formative assessment (e.g. Craig and Orland-Barak, 2015; Maxlow,
        2017).</p>
      <p>Good formative assessment reflects the processes involved in the backward design approach to
        curriculum and assessment shown in Figure 1.4, as well as the assessment cycle illustrated in Figure 1.5. That
        is, formative assessment requires:</p>
      <ol class="nl">
        <li> Knowing where you want learners to arrive (curriculum/lesson/unit goals) </li>
        <li> Finding or devising assessments to determine whether they have reached desired goals </li>
        <li> Planning and implementing appropriate learning experiences </li>
        <li> Using ongoing assessments to assist the learner and to modify instructional approaches. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Although teachers have traditionally assumed responsibility for each of these
        processes, current research suggests that learners need to be centrally involved at all stages.</p>
      <p>This means that learners, like teachers, need to understand learning objectives, and they need to
        know what the criteria for success are. It also means that they need to be involved, in collaboration with their
        teachers and their peers, and in selecting and carrying out the learning tasks that will move them toward
        relevant instructional objectives.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;As we see in Chapter 5, feedback (information learners receives about their performance) is the
        cornerstones of formative assessment. One of the key factors in learner achievement has to do with
        the decisions that the teacher makes in the classroom on a minute-to-minute basis and on the assessment and
        learning strategies that are activated. Teachers have the professional responsibility to be aware of and
        use the best of all possible instructional practices. Formative assessment&mdash;assessment <em>for </em>learning&mdash;is
        one of those &ldquo;best&rdquo; practices.</p>

      <div class="single-column">
        <p class="key-point">Technology provides educators with new ways of packaging and delivering educational offerings, of
          developing and administering assessment procedures, and even of making new discoveries about what works.</p>
        <p class="key-point"><strong>Data mining</strong>&nbsp;in education is basically the mining of educational

        <p class="tx"><em>How can we develop self-regulated, highly motivated learners?</em></p>
        <p class="tx">Developing self-regulated, highly motivated learners is an enormously important task. But how can
          we accomplish this? The feature called &ldquo;In the Classroom: Strategies for Improving Motivation and
          Learning&rdquo; lists a number of suggestions, many of which are recurring themes in this text.</p>

      <div class="single-column">
        <p>As Bakhshinategh, Zaiane, ElAtia, and Ipperciel (2017) point out, there are now a large number of
          online courses, intelligent tutoring systems, and learning management systems that have accumulated vast amounts
          of data relating to learner reactions to problems, conversations among learners and instructors, and test
          performance patterns.</p>
        <p>The mining and analysis of some of this data may yield surprisingly useful ideas for
          designing curricula, improving assessments, and modifying instruction. Data mining in education has been
          used for <em>student modeling</em>, the process of analyzing and representing learner characteristics; for
          assistance in making decisions such as those relating to feedback, lesson sequencing, questioning, and other
          aspects of instruction; and for improving computer-based instructional systems and approaches to evaluation.</p>
        <p>Most of this data-mining is carried out not by teachers but by educational researchers. Teachers then
          have access to the fruits of these mining labors, many of which are published in journal articles.</p>
        <p>A search of educational and computer-related literature reveals enormous current interest in
          practical educational applications of technology and data-mining (see Chapter 3). For example, Cho and Yoo (2017)
          report using a data-mining approach to study online self-regulated learning. </p>

      <h3> Types of Assesment</h3>
      <p>Historically, the main purpose of educational assessment was to provide a grade (<em>summative
        assessment</em>); increasingly, assessment has become an integral part of the day-to-day functioning of
        schools, where it is used to provide feedback for guiding and improving teaching and learning (<em>formative
        assessment</em>: assessment <em>for</em> learning rather than assessment <em>of</em> learning.). <em>Placement
        assessment</em> gathers information useful for placing students in courses, programs, study groups, and so
        on. <em>Performance-based assessment</em>, unlike many paper-and-pencil or computer-based tests, asks
        learners to <em>perform</em> or <em>construct</em> what is being assessed. In education, <em>tests</em> are
        usually specific instruments or procedures used to measure achievement and progress; <em>assessment</em> is a
        more general term for all the activities involved in educational testing and measurement. <em>Evaluation</em> refers to making a <em>value</em> judgment or appraising something relative to certain criteria.</p>
      <h3>Curriculum Planning and Assessment</h3>
      <p>Students tend to study what teachers test and (hopefully) teach; hence the importance of
        educational assessment that measures the intentions (educational goals) of educational systems. The <em>Every
        Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)</em> is the principal piece of legislation governing K-12 education in the U.S.
        It stipulates that all states must develop high educational standards (goals or objectives), and appropriate
        related assessments and approaches to instruction. The <em>backward design approach</em> to curriculum
        building (where the first step identifies standards (goals), the next relates to developing assessments to
        determine progress toward goals, and the third deals with instructional approaches) is highly useful in this
        regard. Collaboration, often in the form of <em>professional learning communities </em>(PLCs), is frequently
        involved at all stages of the curriculum building process including the sharing of standards and approaches
        to assessment and instruction. For assessment and instructional purposes, the most useful learning objectives
        are framed as highly explicit, observable intended outcomes of instructional activities.</p>
      <h3>The implications of Current Legislation</h3>
      <p>Mandates of ESSA relating to high standards, appropriate assessments, and optimal approaches to
        instruction, have led to increased emphasis on the use of <em>common core standards</em> across states, often
        developed by a consortium of educators. This legislation often results in the use of state-wide standardized
        tests, the results of which have important implications for learners, teachers, schools, and educational
        funding, leading to the label <em>high-stakes testing</em>. Assessment of teacher competence, often with <em>thePraxis</em>&trade;
        tests, is another form of high-stakes testing (as was assessment and funding based on the now terminated <em>Race
        to the Top (R2T) program</em>, which granted funds on the basis of school and teacher performance). The <em>Individuals
        with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)</em> also has implications for testing. It outlines the
        school&rsquo;s responsibilities with respect to providing services for children with special needs. It
        guarantees <em>zero rejection</em>, <em>parent participation</em>, education in the <em>least restrictive
        environment</em>, <em>free and appropriate education</em>, <em>fair evaluation</em>, and <em>individual
        education plans (IEPs)</em> for all learners with special needs.</p>
